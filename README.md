# kernel-module-root

This repository explores the use of kernel modules to gain root access on Android devices.

**Disclaimer:** Rooting your Android device using kernel modules carries significant risks, including:

* **Security vulnerabilities:** Potential exposure to malware and unauthorized access.
* **Device instability:** System crashes, boot loops, and other issues.
* **Warranty voiding:** Manufacturers may void your warranty.
* **Data loss:** Incorrect procedures can lead to data loss.
* **Device bricking:** In worst case scenarios, your device can become unusable.

**Use this information at your own risk. The author(s) are not responsible for any damage caused to your device.**

## Overview

Kernel modules are pieces of code that can be loaded into the Android kernel to extend its functionality. In the context of rooting, they can be used to:

* Temporarily or permanently elevate privileges.
* Modify system permissions and user groups.
* Bypass security restrictions.

## Key Concepts

* **Kernel Modules:** Loadable code that extends kernel functionality.
* **Root Access:** Elevated privileges granting complete control over the system.
* **User Groups:** Mechanisms for controlling permissions.

## Methods

This repository may contain examples and information related to:

* **Temporary Rooting:** Loading modules for temporary privilege escalation.
* **Persistent Rooting:** Modifying system files for permanent root access.
* **User Group Manipulation:** Changing user groups to gain root-level permissions.

## Considerations

* This method is device and Android version specific.
* Requires advanced technical knowledge.
* Security implications must be carefully evaluated.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. However, please ensure that any contributions are:

* Clearly documented.
* Safe and responsible.
* Relevant to the topic.
