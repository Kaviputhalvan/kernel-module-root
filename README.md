**Status:** 🚨 **Under Development – Do Not Use Until a Stable Version is Released!** 🚨  

This repository explores the use of kernel modules to gain root access on Android devices.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
Rooting your Android device using kernel modules carries significant risks, including:

- **Security vulnerabilities:** Potential exposure to malware and unauthorized access.
- **Device instability:** System crashes, boot loops, and other issues.
- **Warranty voiding:** Manufacturers may void your warranty.
- **Data loss:** Incorrect procedures can lead to data loss.
- **Device bricking:** In the worst-case scenario, your device can become unusable.

**Use this information at your own risk. The author(s) are not responsible for any damage caused to your device.**

## 📌 Overview
Kernel modules are pieces of code that can be loaded into the Android kernel to extend its functionality. In the context of rooting, they can be used to:

- Temporarily or permanently elevate privileges.
- Modify system permissions and user groups.
- Bypass security restrictions.

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- **Kernel Modules:** Loadable code that extends kernel functionality.
- **Root Access:** Elevated privileges granting complete control over the system.
- **User Groups:** Mechanisms for controlling permissions.

## 🛠️ Methods
This repository may contain examples and information related to:

- **Temporary Rooting:** Loading modules for temporary privilege escalation.
- **Persistent Rooting:** Modifying system files for permanent root access.
- **User Group Manipulation:** Changing user groups to gain root-level permissions.

## ⚠️ Important Considerations
- This method is device and Android version specific.
- Requires advanced technical knowledge.
- Security implications must be carefully evaluated.

## 🚧 Development Status
🚨 **This project is under active development.** 🚨

**DO NOT USE THESE METHODS UNTIL A STABLE VERSION IS RELEASED.**

Using these methods in their early stages **can brick your device**. It is highly recommended to only attempt these procedures after a stable alpha version is released, and only on test devices. **Proceed with extreme caution.**
