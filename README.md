This repository explores the use of kernel modules to gain root access on Android devices by injecting and modifying key system configurations. This approach is useful for gaining deeper control over system processes, testing security vulnerabilities, and developing custom kernel functionalities. It is particularly valuable for researchers and developers looking to understand privilege escalation mechanisms within the Android environment.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
Rooting your Android device using kernel modules carries significant risks, including:

- **Security vulnerabilities:** Potential exposure to malware and unauthorized access.
- **Device instability:** System crashes, boot loops, and other issues.
- **Warranty voiding:** Manufacturers may void your warranty.
- **Data loss:** Incorrect procedures can lead to data loss.
- **Device bricking:** In the worst-case scenario, your device can become unusable.

**Use this information at your own risk. The author(s) are not responsible for any damage caused to your device.**

## üìå Overview
Kernel modules are pieces of code that can be loaded into the Android kernel to extend its functionality. In the context of rooting, they can be used to:

- Temporarily or permanently elevate privileges.
- Modify system permissions and user groups.
- Bypass security restrictions.

This project focuses on creating `root.so`, a kernel module that grants root access to the `su` file by modifying `init.rc`. The modification involves injecting specific commands that adjust system permissions and user group assignments, ensuring root-level access is established. To prevent unintended issues, the module includes safeguards such as validation checks before execution and restoration procedures to revert changes if necessary. The module is designed to load at every startup, ensuring persistent root access. It can be patched and updated via TWRP or other bootable platforms for flashing onto the OS.

## üîë Key Concepts
- **Kernel Modules:** Loadable code that extends kernel functionality.
- **Root Access:** Elevated privileges granting complete control over the system.
- **User Groups:** Mechanisms for controlling permissions.
- **Android Architecture:** Different CPU architectures require specific kernel modifications. **Android requires kernel modules to match its architecture version to function properly. Be cautious when using different versions.**

## üõ†Ô∏è Rooting Methods
This repository may contain examples and information related to:

- **Temporary Rooting:** Loading modules for temporary privilege escalation.
- **Persistent Rooting:** Modifying system files for permanent root access.
- **User Group Manipulation:** Changing user groups to gain root-level permissions.
- **Exploit-Based Rooting:** Using kernel vulnerabilities for root access.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations
- This method is device and Android version specific.
- Requires advanced technical knowledge.
- Security implications must be carefully evaluated. Ensure that best practices are followed, such as verifying module integrity, restricting access to sensitive operations, and applying only trusted sources. Unverified modifications or improper implementation can introduce vulnerabilities that compromise system integrity.
- **Ensure that the module is free from malware before flashing. Do not use versions from unverified sources, as they may inject malicious code.**

**DO NOT USE THESE METHODS UNTIL A STABLE VERSION IS RELEASED.**

Using these methods in their early stages **can brick your device**. If your device becomes unresponsive, you may attempt recovery using fastboot, TWRP, or ADB commands. In extreme cases, restoring the original firmware via Odin (for Samsung), SP Flash Tool (for MediaTek), or a factory image from the manufacturer may be necessary. It is highly recommended to only attempt these procedures after a stable alpha version is released, and only on test devices. **Proceed with extreme caution.**
